# FlyingSquid: More Interactive Weak Supervision

INSERT LOGO HERE

FlyingSquid is a new framework for automatically building models from multiple
noisy label sources.
Users write functions that generate noisy labels for data, and FlyingSquid uses
the agreements and disagreements between them to learn a _label model_ of how
accurate the _labeling functions_ are.
The label model can be used directly for downstream applications, or it can be
used to train a powerful end model:
