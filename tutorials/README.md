# Tutorials

We have two tutorials to help you get started:
* Basics
* Video and Sequential Data
Check out the [examples](../examples) folder to see more examples, including a
simple PyTorch integration!

## Basics
Check out `01 Basics.ipynb` to get started.
We'll use some simple synthetic data to introduce you to FlyingSquid's API.

## Video and Sequential Data
Next, check out `02 Video.ipynbj` to see how FlyingSquid can be used to model
sequential dependencies for applications like video.
