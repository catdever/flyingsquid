# Tutorials

We have three tutorials to help you get started:
* Basics
* Video and Sequential Data
* Online Learning

## Basics
Check out `01 Basics.ipynb` to get started.
We'll use some simple synthetic data to introduce you to FlyingSquid's API.

## Video and Sequential Data
Next, check out `02 Video.ipynbj` to see how FlyingSquid can be used to model
sequential dependencies for applications like video.

## Online Learning
Finally, check out NOTEBOOK to see how FlyingSquid can be used to support
online learning -- including a PyTorch extension that allows you to re-train
the label model _in the training loop_ of a more powerful end model.
